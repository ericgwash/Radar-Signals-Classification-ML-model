# Ionosphere Data Science Project

This project uses machine learning to classify radar signals as "good" or "bad" based on data collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador. The data was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. A random forest classifier was used to build a model that can predict the class of a radar signal based on its other characteristics. The model was evaluated using cross-validation and grid search, and its performance was assessed using various metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Radar-Signals-Classification-ML-model.git

2. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Usage

1. Run the following command to train the model and evaluate its performance:

python main.py


2. The output will show the model's accuracy on the training and test sets, as well as the best hyperparameters found through cross-validation and grid search.

## Data

### Source

UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ionosphere

### Description

The dataset consists of 351 instances and 34 variables. The target variable is a binary class indicating whether a radar signal is "good" or "bad". The other variables are various characteristics of the radar signal.

### Preprocessing

The data was split into training and test sets, and the features were scaled using standardization. Missing values were handled using imputation.

## Analysis

### Methodology

A random forest classifier was used to build a model that predicts the class of a radar signal based on its other characteristics. The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Findings

The model achieved an accuracy of 0.87 on the test set.

## Conclusion

The results of this project demonstrate that it is possible to use machine learning to classify radar signals based on their characteristics. Further work could be done to improve the model's performance and explore other classification techniques.

## Future Work

- Explore the use of other classification algorithms, such as support vector machines or logistic regression.
- Investigate the impact of different feature selections on the model's performance.
- Analyze the model's performance on different subsets of the data to identify any trends or patterns.
